Strategies
Take a break after 2 hours.

Techniques
• Bruteforce: meet-in-the-middle, backtracking, memoization
• DP (write full draft, include ALL loop bounds), easy direction
• Precomputation
• Divide and Conquer
• Binary search
• lg(n) datastructures
• Mathematical insight
• Randomisation
• Look at it backwards
• Common subproblems? Memoization
• Compute modulo primes and use CRT

WA
• Beware of typos
• Test sample input; make custom testcases
• Read carefully
• Check bounds (use long long or long double)
• EDGE CASES: n ∈ {−1, 0, 1, 2}. Empty list/graph?
• Off by one error (in indices or loop bounds)
• Not enough precision
• Assertions
• Missing modulo operators
• Cases that need a (completely) different approach

TLE
• Infinite loop
• Use scanf or fastIO instead of cin
• Wrong algorithm (is it theoretically fast enough)
• Micro optimizations (but probably the approach just isn’t right)

RTE
• Typos
• Off by one error (in array index of loop bound)
• return 0 at end of program
